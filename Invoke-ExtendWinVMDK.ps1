.SYNOPSIS
This script provides a step-by-step process to extend a windows guest VMDK. 
.DESCRIPTION
This script provides a step-by-step process to extend a windows guest VMDK. 

It's based on the VMware.VIM.Automation.Core PS Snap-In, which is included/part of PowerCLI.
The script will first walk you through increasing the size of a .VMDK. Once that is complete, if the guest
is running a Windows OS, it will ask if you would like to extend a possible associated partition, within
the OS; if you accept, it uses the 'echo' command to output readable DISKPART commands into a file on the
root of C:\, on the VM. After the file is created, DISKPART runs the commands in the .txt file and returns
the output to the shell for the user to review.
